# Cutshort Onboarding

- [UI from Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15669113-Onboarding-Exploration)
- ReactJs
- TailwindCSS
- React Router Dom

### Method Choosen to implement

- Since the only requirement was to build an onboarding page, I have chosen to use routes to build different pages of the onboarding process.

### Other Method I could have used

- I could have made it such that after each page is done the user is redirected to the next component without any changes in the route itself.
